Monkey Go Happy (p5.js Game)
A browser-based endless runner mini-game inspired by the "Monkey Go Happy" titles, built using JavaScript and the p5.js / p5.play.js libraries. Features sprite animation, collision detection, and responsive controls, making it an ideal demonstration of beginner-to-intermediate game development skills for web platforms.

🚀 Features
Animated Sprites: Multiple character and object sprites with smooth animations for player, obstacles, and collectibles.

Endless Runner Mechanics: Procedurally spawned food (bananas) and obstacles, encouraging replayability.

Score and Progression: Real-time scorekeeping, with increasing difficulty and scaling character as score increases.

Keyboard Controls: Responsive jumping and physics using keyboard events and gravity.

Clean UI and Graphics: Custom PNG assets for characters, objects, and background.

🛠 Tech Stack
JavaScript (ES5/ES6)

p5.js: Creative coding and canvas rendering

p5.play.js: Sprite and game logic for p5.js

HTML5 / CSS3: Page structure and minimal styling

🎮 How to Run
Clone the repository.

Open index.html in a modern web browser (no build step required).

Use the space bar to jump and collect bananas while avoiding obstacles.

✨ What Makes This Project Stand Out
Game Engine Use: Demonstrates practical application of p5.play.js for recruiters seeking familiarity with creative coding tools.

Sprite Animation & Scaling: Player character grows as the score increases; collisions trigger dynamic resizing.

Self-Contained Demo: No dependencies beyond included libraries and assets; ideal for live coding demos or teaching.

Clean, readable code: Each function focuses on a distinct aspect (spawn food, spawn obstacles, player movement, scoring).
